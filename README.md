# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data about bank customers. We aim to predict the y variable.

The best performing model was the AutoML model.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
We used a logistic regression model for doing classification. We use automated hyperparameter tuning with hyperdrive.

Random Sampling is faster than grid sampling and both yield almost the same accuracy.

Bandit Policy terminates runs where the primary is not within the specified slack factor compared to the best performing run.

## AutoML
The model generated by AutoML was more accurate.

## Pipeline comparison
The performance of the logistic regression model compared to the AutoML model was lower than expected, despite the use of hyperdrive.

## Future work
The learning rate of the sampling method should be improved in future instances.
